Hey! Welcome to my Instagram Threads recreation.
This project is my final project for App Team Carolina's iOS Learning Academy Fall 2023 using Swift.

Using the integration of Firebase, the features below can be found in my recreation.

**Authentication:**
   - **User Registration and Login:** Firebase Authentication allows for seamless user registration and login processes. Users can sign up using email/password or authenticate through third-party providers like Google, Facebook, or Twitter.
   - **Secure Access:** Firebase handles the security aspects of user authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access specific features and data within the app.
   - **Custom Authentication:** Firebase supports custom authentication mechanisms, enabling you to implement your own authentication system if needed.

**Analytics:**
   - **User Behavior Analysis:** Firebase Analytics provides valuable insights into user behavior. You can track user engagement, popular features, and user demographics to make data-driven decisions for app improvements.
   - **Event Tracking:** Define custom events in Firebase Analytics to track specific user interactions, such as posting a tweet, liking a post, or following another user.

**Security:**
   - **Security Rules:** Firebase allows you to define security rules to control access to the database and storage. This ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can read or modify data.
   - **User Data Protection:** Implement Firebase security best practices to protect user data and privacy, adhering to industry standards and regulations.

**Logging In and Out:**
   - **Session Management:** Firebase Authentication handles user sessions securely. Users remain logged in until they explicitly log out or their session expires.
   - **Logout Functionality:** Implement a logout feature to allow users to sign out securely. Firebase makes it easy to manage user authentication states.

Thanks for reading <3
